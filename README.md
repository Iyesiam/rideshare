# RideShare

RideShare is a real-time ETA calculation project designed to provide accurate estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculations for a predefined route with multiple stops. 
It utilizes React for the front-end development and integrates with the Google Maps API for map rendering and marker placement.
# Features

1. Interactive map displaying the entire route with marked stops.
2. Real-time tracking of the driver's current location.
3. Calculation of ETA for each stop based on a constant average speed.
4. Dynamic updating of information as the driver progresses along the route.

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

1. ## Node.js installed on your system.
2. ## Google Maps API key for map rendering. You can obtain it from the Google Cloud Platform console.

 # Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install project dependencies by running the command:
### npm install

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
